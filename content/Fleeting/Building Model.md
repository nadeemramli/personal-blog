What if the model I have right now do not serving me well?

What's the objective of the model?

How do I come up with the model? 
	"Through observation, you've been observing and rationalize path that people took to be successful"

What if the path was only prescription of it?
	"The path was actually a representation of their discipline, where they find peacefulness in their [work and hardship](Levelling Up)."
