Early 20s is such a great year.

It was the year that you're dumb enough to do risky things, and it was the year that you have no commitment whatsoever to commit into great work.

Nassim Taleb even mentioned in his tweet:
> + In your early 20s, learn maths & how to make solid money (~ impossible later)

Which he then elaborate what it meant to make solid money:
> Note 1: "learn how to make solid money" --if that's what you want to do. Having a technical specialty (dentistry) is one way to have solid finances. Or being very, very good at something. But I've never seen anyone suddenly learn financial acumen late in life. It's like math.

This has kept me wonder, what does it mean to have technical specialty, or being very good at something.


Hypothesis
1. Technical Specialty
2. Entrepreneurship
3.
