To level up, you are required to beat the [[Who is your Enemy|dungeon master (enemy)]].

But beating your enemy is impossible if you aren't capable of it. Paradoxically, there's also no point of beating an enemy that is lower than your level, meaning there's no point of beating enemy that you're capable of. 

To level up, you are not just required to beat the dungeon master. You are required to beat the [gap](whats stopping you) that been blocking you from beating the dungeon master.

Thus from there you will earn experience.
