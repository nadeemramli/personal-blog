## Levels and Gap
-------
**Levels and Gap is important for growth.**

When we talk about growth, we're talking about a perpetual incremental changes that will either stop (or slow down) when it reach it's ceiling or it's objective, whichever come first.

The problem with the premise above is, ethic (approach) problem.

If you look too forward, hyperfixating the ceiling or the objective, it gave us an illusion that such growth will happen in linear fashion. 

==Nassim Taleb describe this problem as Top-down Approach, a top-down approach are just fragile, it was design and focused to be oversimplify due to reductionism and lack of knowledge.==

*I also think that a top-down approach has too much of noises, where we're actually focusing too much at a [[Layers of Cause and Effect|prescription]] of a problem/results. Essentially, it need more than just observations.*

While we also have a Bottom-up Approach, where we just grow and scale from point A (current/local) to point B (next) perpetually, and eventually reach a ceiling. This type of Growth also can be deceiving, but this time the one that deluded it is ourselves. 

*Bottom-Up Approach focus more on intrinsic growth/values. Where decision-making and "strategy" are focused more towards empirical evidence and practical experience. This type of approach rely heavily on one's capacity to be present and persistency*

We often time don't see that it is required to grow bottom-up due to the lack of visibility (clarity) of those changes, and also due to the pain/stress it incurred to be present during the changes.

### Then Why Bro?
------
This is why Levels and Gap is important for growth.

An anecdote of this, is when I tried to aim for a body building benchmark. I didn't like cutting that much but I really like that bulking look.

*My benchmark for body building is simply that powerlifter dude with a long ass beard and that 4x4 trucks. I mean airplane can also, like why not*

So I tried to study the numbers behind it, like how much do I have to weigh, how much do I have to lift, what would be the benchmark, and how much do I have to eat in calories to achieve such physique.

It is mind boggling, how big the Levels and Gap are:
- I'm currently struggling to even deadlift 140kg, while for these guys, they actually bench pressing 150kg. 
- According to the weightlifting standard, bench press usually the lightest one of the three major lifts. 
- The ratio of {Bench Press : Deadlift} would be around {1 : 2}

 So that mean, if I want to achieve that size and that muscle power, I have to achieve **Deadlifting 300kg.**

That's crazy.

*Or is it? Aniq actually lift 300kg while weighing 55kg. I think I could achieve 300kg while weighing 100kg at least.*

But it also almost the same with thinking power aswell. 
- To achieve a level of analytical and impact, there are levels and gap aswell. But it is more deceiving than ever, due the measurement for this level and gap are just really hard to gauge. 
- I think also why we all sometimes overestimate our intelligence, and underestimate "learning".

But I never saw it that way, I never thought that there is levels and gap for thinking.

### So What Can We Do?
-----
So based of this observations, the best that we can do is simply to always remind ourselves that we are probably dumb. 

Or just adopt Socrates principle
> "The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing"

Also, it is an awareness to kept believing that we can always grow.

Just like bodybuilding, learning and thinking can aswell, grow. We should always strive to read more, to learn more, to find better ways to understand ourselves, and to improve our competency. It's a hard knock to the head to basically says that life is within our control, and we should have as much agency to act upon it.

So yeah, kept on treading man.
