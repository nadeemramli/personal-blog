 Mastery and Greatness to me are two different things that requires each other to work.

The way that I explained these two scenarios would be something like this:

Mastery is within our control but Greatness are beyond of our control but as we are destined to be great. 

1. The Birth Lottery
2. Competency
3. Randomness + Optionality

First of all, I think any of these can't be achieve if we're lacking of [[Becoming Who You Are|agency]]. 

It's important for us to understand the path of uniqueness for the above to happen.



Conditioning by living in a World. 
That's what stopping us from achieving high performance. 

Exposure, if you're exposed to coach potato, you will be coach potato.

The core of who you are, there's no how to

It's all about realization. 

Realization creates their own path. 

If you have a back-ache you don't ask how to, you just "realize" how to solves it.

Through curiosity

And only it matters if it matters to you

What do you care

your ability to keep doing interesting things is your willingness to be embarrassed again and go back to step one and start as a beginner and get your ass kicked and look stupid doing things.



Paul Graham

When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out. Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true.  
  
I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new country where I don't know how things work.  
  
It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally.  
  
For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works differently. And yet you'll know more if you move. So the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual ignorance.  
  
But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?  
  
I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us "Come on, come on, figure this out." Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.  
  
Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our dislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike of feeling like a noob does too.  
  
Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.
