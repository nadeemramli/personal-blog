title: Truth, Ignorance and Meanings
draft: true

I love capturing knowledges as it make me feels safe towards unknown-unknown risk. But capturing knowledges don't actually make you safer.

So I develop a model that help me navigate through this:

1. Follow your intuition
2. Use knowledge to help that

To think about this, just do whatever it is your heart wants you to do, but use knowledges to ensure better outcome. 

My ideas:
1. Value and intuition as compass and direction
2. Operationally driven 
3. Knowledge as guidance and course correction

Pursue the truth, and the truth will prevail, only then ignorance is a bliss.

The overall concept:

1. Engines
2. Find the truth, follow the truth and avoid corruption.
3. "We must apprehend that mastery is something cultivated over numerous years of focused effort, sustained by passion, and guided by an inner vision of a goal to be realized."













Another place you can use this concept is, working out.

Science bro wasn't meant to be more effective, it was meant to be more efficient, and make working out more fun.





This whole idea was meant to put practice above theory, but making sure that we're not degrading the value of theory.
