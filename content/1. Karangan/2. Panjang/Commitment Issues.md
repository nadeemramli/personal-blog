Alright, so let's talk about something that kind of interested me a little bit. So we have been in a pursuit of trying to find what to build. So this idea of trying to find what to build was basically a pursuit of identifying the prerequisite or the pre-requirement for you to achieve the dream business that you want to build, and identifying what are the step by step that you have to go through for them to build it. So you're trying to plan out the right business, sort of the right entry point, if we're using [[The Fundamental of Trading|the trading model]] here, the right entry point for you to get into this setup or this playbook or whatever it is, which is basically [[The S-Curve|the idea of building wealth is pretty much an S curve]]. So there's always an entry point of the starting point of that wealth building.

  

[00:01:14] But that's the root question, I think the first question is the relationship of business and wealth building. I kind of want to know how strong it is, because if we can confirm that almost  a lot of

  

[00:01:27] people wealth building through, or we kind of have to also understand the concave part. Usually people penetrate the growth stages through business or through saving and things that.

  

[00:01:47] But if you ask me, I don't think it's through saving. It won't be possible because saving is pretty much linear. It can be compounded, but it's a little bit later in life.

  

[00:01:58] So Nassan Talib said that if you're in the concave, the way that you can get out fast is you have to do radical technical innovation, or you can build up debt, something  that, or to reduce debt, something  that, which is quite interesting.

  

[00:02:24] So we kind of have to, I can pretty much conclude as of now, my hypothesis is that in order for you to get out from the growth, the concave part of wealth building is you have to do something that is innovative.

  

[00:02:40] So innovative. And in order for you to do something that innovative, you have to kind of  tinkering around, that's the whole idea.

  

[00:02:51] So, okay, the next question I have is that, okay, what should I be tinkering at? So what do I want to tinker about? And I think that has been all of my problem, trying to figure out what exactly what to

  

[00:03:08] do and to focus at one thing. But then I come up with this guy who I believe, based on my experience, I kind of understand, he was going through and reading a book from Oxford, where that book was, that book is

  

[00:03:27] basically talking about the world of expertise by Oxford, handbook. And he found the person that inspired, he inspired her to kind of do all of this stuff, which is, he found in the book of the Handbook of Expertise by Oxford, there's chapter 35

  

[00:03:52] expertise in business, which written by Leah A. DiBello and this guy, Cedric Chin. Accidentally, not really accidentally, I do believe that the circumambulation idea also implemented here, where you always have this passion and it always draws you out.

  

[00:04:15] You just have to find all of this inspiration or whatever it is. And he read a lot of other things, but the one that caught his attention is the expertise in business as well.

  

[00:04:31] So I do believe that he read everything else as well. So you're in this position that you really want to know everything, you want to know all kind of optionality that is available to you.

  

[00:04:40] But I think going through all of that, what he got next is expertise in business and he come up with all of this obsession, obsession towards the study of business and pretty much build his whole business out of that.

  

[00:05:04] So the idea is that sometimes for you to get the optionality, you have to do it. So imagine this, imagine that if the guy was  reading all of the expertise in business and all that and never actually dive deep.

  

[00:05:32] So you have  number one, you expose yourself to everything, all optionality. And number two is  you actually dive deep. So I think my biggest problem in trying to committing into something and tinkering around

  

[00:05:49] was always been the dive deep. So I have so many optionality. , there's another problem as well, which not really helping me.

  

[00:06:00] the paradox of trying to figure out what to do is that the more you're trying to figure out what to do, the more that you actually cannot do anything because of the fact that every single time, imagine this.

  

[00:06:14] So you're trying to figure out things that you want to do and you start to realize that, Oh, actually every single time that I try to find something to do, I always end up with more things that I can't choose to do.

  

[00:06:32] You see, she basically a choice paradox. So there's, I believe there's a paradox. Paradox in decision.

  

[00:06:45] I think, yeah, the paradox of choice. The more options that you have, the less satisfied that you have. So you kind of need to be ignorant in certain part.

  

[00:07:04] You have to kind of stop looking. And for people who basically have curiosity of everything, stop to look. It's really hard.

  

[00:07:14] So my biggest problem is actually not to figure out what to do. My biggest problem is to figure out my commitment issue. Literally, how can you be most satisfied with your decisions?

  

[00:07:31] I guess that's my biggest problem because fundamentally the paradox of choice is a concept that introduce the more options that we have, the less satisfied we feel with our decisions. So if you have so many options, it's really hard for you to commit to anything because

  

[00:07:51] you have so many options. So you kind of have to reduce or somehow, there's two ways that you can do here. Number one, you can somehow build these boundaries of looking at other options.

  

[00:08:08] So it's really hard for you to see anything as an option. So you kind of , instead of thinking that, oh, I can do anything, you probably want to start thinking that you cannot do anything.

  

[00:08:18] You were just going to do one thing and this is the stuff that you pretty much do. So you kind of close up all of these potential and capacity for you to actually do anything else making your option much, much lesser.

  

[00:08:34] The second part will be , you have to be really, really satisfied and appreciate and pretty much grateful of what you're doing right now. Making that whatever it is that you're doing right now, it's really hard for you to see

  

[00:08:53] any other option because of you're really grateful of what you have. It's  the analogy here that you can use is in marriage, right? So if you're really happy with your wife, it's most likely that you won't see anybody

  

[00:09:06] else as an option. It's the same way with the wife as well. But the problem is when we're thinking about wealth building, it's really hard for you

  

[00:09:22] to just be satisfied with whatever that you have right now since the goal of the wealth building is to actually be wealthy. So when you're trying to be wealthy and you want to be satisfied with the things that

  

[00:09:35] you're doing right now that actually not impacting to your wealth, it's really hard for you to be satisfied. So if you kind of reframe, for example,  if you're using wealthy as a navigation tools

  

[00:09:49] as of now, you will always be in this position that it's really hard for you to be satisfied with whatever is the flow or the path that you're going through right now. So I think this idea also come from Robert Greene where Robert Greene was talking about

  

[00:10:24] two track mind. You kind of have to have two track. One to be less disciplined and really enjoy your life, do as much as possible, learn,

  

[00:10:36] absorb, become a sponge, really do anything, say yes to a lot of stuff. And then you also want to have  50% or 60% or maybe, personally I would say that maybe 64% actually.

  

[00:10:51] You want to be able to in the track one, a track two which is more disciplined, more focus into it, something that you already have. I think this also come with the idea of the circumambulation that you always know what

  

[00:11:02] you want to do in life. You just have to keep on figuring out what is it and unravel the layers step by step. This is by Carl Jung.

  

[00:11:12] So the more that you focus on the discipline part which will be very painful. I think the guy Andrej Kapoity as well. Andrej Kapoity from OpenAI right?

  

[00:11:24] I don't know where he is right now. He also said that learning should be suffering, learning should be painful. Which goes back to track two will be painful path, will be painful track.

  

[00:11:37] So you need discipline for you to stay in that track. I think that making, yeah, so if you in this position of trying to build wealth and you have to choose whether you are in track one, track two.

  

[00:12:05] You really, it's really hard for you to be satisfied for whatever it is that you do for track one and track two. Because maybe if you're in your early twenties, it's really hard for you to see where is this

  

[00:12:20] going to go. And also the same, I think it's probably going to be also the same until your thirties right? So you have this idea of what I have to do something that  what Neville Ravikin said

  

[00:12:34] that always bleeding edge. Andresen Horowitz also said the same stuff. he never read, he either, the way that he managed his information diet is that he

  

[00:12:46] either  read something that is very fundamental that have Lindy effect or he read some things that some really fast, ,  news or things  that, that give him bleeding edge of what happening to the reality right now.

  

[00:13:02] With that being said, fundamentally I think that you and Neville Ravikin also said the same stuff. It's  for people who actually get  luck number four, I think, or luck number

  

[00:13:15] three, where basically  how to get, how to get rich without getting lucky is that you have to do stuff and be really good at it until when the world actually needing that the most, you are the best at that because of when everybody was chasing something else,

  

[00:13:36] you chasing on that one stuff because of it is under your track, which is your track two. It's under your circumambulation. You  it, you achieve mastery of it.

  

[00:13:44] You discipline with it. It's painful. Nobody else  you, et cetera, et cetera, and everything.

  

[00:13:49] So it's  you're really in a concave where you see nothing, you're bleeding every, every single month, but then suddenly something happened in the world and you have that this exponential growth, right?

  

[00:14:01] So that's track one. So track two, obviously you want to be able to open as much as luck surface area. So you're probably going to get that luck pretty much faster because unless you're doing

  

[00:14:15] something very innovative,  I don't know, deep learning back then or quantum machine back then, then probably the track one of your life will be  exponentially grow because of the world suddenly needed.

  

[00:14:31] But I believe as human ceilings and capacity, most probably you want to always increase your luck surface area because the, the, the, the, the, the probability for the opportunity to actually grow, be exponential  that is different if you, if you, if you just an

  

[00:14:52] individual for example. So it's different from you actually have building a business for a very specific niche quantum learning.

  

[00:14:59] I don't know. So with that in mind, the, the, the, the clashing ideas here is that when you trying to choose what you want in life, there's a lot of models that you have to unravel here.

  

[00:15:25] So there's track one, track two from Robert Green, there's how to get reached by a never ever can. And then there's a lot of ways.

  

[00:15:34] I think, I think this guy also been talking about, , how to read books, which is when you, , said Richard believe that, , business can be learned and you have to have some level of cognitive agility for you to transfer, learn that mental models.

  

[00:15:51] Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett always say that you have to read more. That's how you solve problem. I think a lot of other business people also read a lot of books to solve problem and also

  

[00:16:01] to expose themselves to problems so they can see that. And so with all of this model, it's really hard for you to figure out and commit into something test the option for you to just be satisfied of what you're doing right now

  

[00:16:18] will be really hard because in order for you to do that, you kind of have to shut down all of these optionality and actually believe what you're doing is correct, which is really risky if you ask me that, that is really risky.

  

[00:16:37] Imagine that you've been doing the same thing at very, very long time and it doesn't work. People will look at you as crazy and ignorance, right? But if it is what people will say that you're, you're so smart, you're genius.

  

[00:16:51] But the thing is what people been listening to this type of voice from people who actually successful because a lot happening to them. But there's a lot more people who actually  this as well, who never got that optionality

  

[00:17:05] and eventually they just, they just dead because of that. So we read all of these great books from 1970 or 1980 and we never even know these people unless you actually in really deep root of that problem or that domain, then you probably

  

[00:17:25] probably going to read all of these great people who's been in this position for a very long time, but never get the optionality. It always been  that.

  

[00:17:34] So fundamentally you want to be able to balance it out between track one and track two. So if you use the framing to really understand about this, you have peace, kind of peacefulness path, wealth path, wealth building path, and then you have health path.

  

[00:18:02] So, let's say that you have been building all of this stuff. Let's do this. So fundamentally, I think in philosophical life, so there's life and work.

  

[00:18:44] For life, you can use the wealth building, etc. Because it's really that, , just the principles for you to handle the life part was quite  that for me.

  

[00:18:59] So there's a principle that you can follow, which is basically the law of the most, which is I kind of, that's the name I call it, probably I change it. I think marginal frontier, I will call it that way because that's basically from e-commerce.

  

[00:19:16] The law of the marginal frontier is that there's specific marginal incremental impact and significance if you do certain things at certain level of quantity. If you want to preserve health, you have to eat healthy every day and you have to vary

  

[00:19:33] it, , variability is also important. That's another stuff. And then you have to eat healthy every day.

  

[00:19:42] You have to be, , vary your routines and your eating diet, etc. And number three, you kind of have to at least work out a week, right? If you're following the marginal frontier law, you have to work out a week, one time

  

[00:19:59] a week. The improvement will increase after, if you do twice a week. And it will start to have a diminished return effect when you do third time, fourth time,

  

[00:20:13] fifth time, but it's always better, but not really that big. So you kind of have some ideas that you can't never skip one day at least. The best, the optimal is two days and everything else is  if you really want to pump it

  

[00:20:27] out, right? So you have this idea in life. And you can implement all other principles, , things  philosophy.

  

[00:20:40] I also figure out there's a principles of practicalities and philosophies, , to handle depression, things  that, which I wrote in Reflection on Suffering. So there's a lot of ways for you to handle life.

  

[00:20:55] So when it comes to work, this is a little bit different, , because we're not dealing it as how life should be. We're not handling it as how business is.

  

[00:21:06] I believe there must be some level of separation in these models, in this identity that you have to think about. We also have to think about, , level of mastery, , for you to be the best

  

[00:21:20] at 1%, to be 1% at anything, because that's also important to have as much as optionality as possible. You kind of have to do something that is integrated into your life so much you're obsessed about

  

[00:21:35] it, which is a little bit more philosophical and more psychological than actually more practical to think about. So that's a few things that you have to also consider when you're trying to choose what

  

[00:21:48] to do. But there's a thing, right? , this guy, he figured out a really interesting topic and become the best at it because he

  

[00:21:59] knew it that day that he wants to do all of this and he now just do that for entire life. And I believe that all of businesses also work almost the same. It's always  that.

  

[00:22:14] You want to be able to figure out optionality, option, and just be in the whole time to just commit into it and become the best at it and do it for 5 or 6 years and you're finally financially free.

  

[00:22:28] So the paradox here is that in order for you to commit to something, you have to be satisfied with whatever it is you're doing or you have to somehow set boundaries, which also both of this is risky.

  

[00:22:44] So what exactly is happening here? I don't know. Let's transcribe this and improve this and let's think about it.
