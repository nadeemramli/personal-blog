I love capturing knowledges as it make me feels safe towards unknown-unknown risk. But capturing knowledges don't actually make you safer.

So I develop a model that help me navigate through this:

1. Follow your intuition
2. Use knowledge to help that

To think about this, just do whatever it is your heart wants you to do, but use knowledges to ensure better outcome. 

My ideas:
1. Value and intuition as compass and direction
2. Operationally driven 
3. Knowledge as guidance and course correction

Pursue the truth, and the truth will prevail, only then ignorance is a bliss.
