There was a point in my life where is my life mission is to prove myself that I am capable to do things that I've said/set to do.

It was really a simple idea, being able to do what you said/set you want to do. (create a new article talking about this, inside the article got some principles, axiom, such as, manage expectation, overdeliver. Don't bite more than what you can chew, but try to eat faster. Distraction is the reason of lacking of mastery, this is also a problem for future-generation. Managing thoughts-branching )

The idea of being able to do exactly what you said you want to do, was so simple there's no charms in pursuing such mission. Which is the reason I forgot about this idea.

Until recently where I've read that to measure one's integrity in their work ethic, you can watch whether they do what they said they want to do, and I stumped on how simple it is have integrity (refer to how important it is of integrity/accountability in life) (yet many won't care about this - refer to hanlon's razor)

Being able to do what you, you want to do is a superpower (so if you're capable to do, you must know the power that you have) - "with great power comes great responsibility".

It is so powerful, it can also consumes an individual, whereby the person with this superpower are capable of having so much optionality, that they're can dabble into anything and be good at it fast. Despite that it sounds great, this can be a reason of one succumb into such noises, and unable to really tap into the depth of expertise/mastery. - refer to mastery (problems with lack of depth), refers to track mindset, circumambulation.

This is the issue that I have, where it seems like I problem with [[Commitment Issues|committing]] into something. 

I've realize that I am capable to do many things (refer to learning curve - where you got AI), not only that, I am also very curious of a lot of things. But the idea of having too many things on your plate are not really that ideal in an environment where focus and "performance" matters. 

But the question here also important to understand, why do when focus and performance matter, being able to have optionality to able to do anything can be a problem?

The reason here is because of our constraints as a human itself.

By starting your day thinking about "what can you do" today (which is heuristic by nature, - refer to man fall into their system) are the first layer of understanding your constraints.

You always end up in this thought process of "what are you capable of doing", that you know that you can do, and this type of thinking is a heuristic thinking behavior that happen due to "Comfortability". (read why Discipline & conscientiousness is a great indicator of success, try to hire more fit people, or more "work people". ). Comfort is what drive this type of thinking, cause you always want to "land" on the zone that didn't challenge you, but got the benefit of the work-process.


 The second layer would be, what are you curious about (this would be a little bit of relating to Circumambulation ideas where you're working on things you're naturally have attraction to), this however have to ensure that it was not just a simple Dopaminergic signal coming from noises available out there ( thinking clear, avoiding Shiny Object Syndrome, Dopamine Economy.
 
 The third layer would be focusing on High Impact work. The high impact work is what I believe requiring the committing values. 

But impact here is a little bit "vague", how do we know we're focusing on the right task? How do evaluate a pursue is worth it?

Let's work on a thought experiment here a little bit. Provided we're capable of doing anything. What would we do?

Well we might do everything that we probably want to do right?

Well, human desire are pretty much relentless here, so we can't rely on that indicator to become our compass/judgment for decision making. So what can we use for our judgement here? (Related to human desire, and values etc as compass)

Probably something that is more meaningful, and something that we wouldn't mind dying for.

Well now we have both (execution and strategy), being able to execute and direction of where we going, well this is great right?

Except, let's add another variable. Let's say in this ideal world, we have constraints, and that constraint is:

(write an article to figure out the constraints analogy here, but we wanna end up using Aspiration hour as main constraint.)

 The main idea of constraint as criteria for committing lies from these readings.
