For my recent reflection, I've realized why I am sometimes "Addicted" to my work, and mistook it as obsession and passion.

I thought (more like Hiding It) working was my "thing". I thought that I just like working, or be doing something impactful.

But it was a little bit deeper than that, it was the need of constantly be doing something you're good at. This was what been pushing me.

Well of course it is great, because you will keep on doing it.

It is also consuming cause now, you are afraid of doing things that you're not good at. Which means, you will never learn new thing, you will never take on challenges where you will look stupid or have higher probability of failure.

You will constantly pulled towards thing that help you look or feel "good", and you'll constantly biased towards it.

This will hinder you from doing risky but rewarding endeavor.

I also realize I tried to cover this up by creating a process of learning, so can I lie to myself that I am challenging myself of doing something new. But it was just Im trying to do something good, which is learning and covering new topic.

While this traits can have a big downside, it can also be A GREAT upside.

If only you apply the same addiction towards something that is GREAT for you.

Something will be great if its:
1. Meaningful
2. Wealth creation/building 
3.
