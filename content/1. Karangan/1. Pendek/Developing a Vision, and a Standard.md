My whole understanding of how to develop a vision is tough. It wasn’t just a pure dream that you took from others where you subconsciously synthesized and deemed it like it yours.

For me a vision is a reason, a why, a root cause of “you”. It should be meaningful, self-fulfilling and valuable for you. Vision should gives you strength and most importantly give you Hope ([Philosophy helps, with Hope.](https://www.notion.so/Philosophy-helps-with-Hope-bf570bde382743bdb526928b1559d71e?pvs=21))

For a vision to gives such strength, it requires more than just a dream. It requires faith, it requires you to believe in it, even though in the absence of the evidence.

A vision must be

1. Meaningful
2. Valuable
