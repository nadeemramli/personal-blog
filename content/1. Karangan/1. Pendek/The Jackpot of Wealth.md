Luck Surface Area + Equity


I do believe there's some power when you able to find a strong model and combine them with other strong model.

The relationship between these model itself able to create a whole paradigm of impact that is more impactful than what a single model could do.


A model itself is powerful to be use to navigate and help you see the realities better.

But a combination of 2 and 3 models together, can be powerful and impactful enough to make it reality and principles.

For an example, Luck Surface Area + Equity.

These model are super powerful for wealth creation.
