I think now we live in this world where, we can easily say our opinion, or provide advice to others, and those information will either be broadcasted or misinterpreted. 

In this digital social age, where we can hear people's advice, anywhere, everywhere, and whoever. The advices was given from a person to a person, where we will be overhearing them. Or the advices will be given from a person who projected his audiences, and now you're a subjected to be the audience.

We can't stop this behavior, we can't stop people saying things online, or doing things online.

However we could at least filter them off.

The implication of the above situation, are more prone towards those who're listening. 

These people who're listening, what are you doing with that new information?

Is that information are just a "statement", an "opinion" or an "advices"?

They don't state their intention with it, but most importantly how do you interpret it?

A statement, bla bla bla
An opinion bla bla bla
An advices

We surely know how to categorize these information right? right......

We could have judgement to it, but we don't realize how it turned to be opinion once we have judgement on it. I mean we can ignore, but what if it would be useful?

So all these micro-decision we're trying to make didn't exactly look that visible, but it's polluting your state of mind without you're realizing it. You're making subconscious effort to wrap your head around the concept/ideas behind the information you had just now. 

So what should we do about it?

To be honest, I think the best that we could do is to have a principle/best practices to work around it.

Quest in game, advices in life stages.
