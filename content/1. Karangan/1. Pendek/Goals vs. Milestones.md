We've been taught from early childhood that Goal are what drove focus and success.

Well it is true that it drives Focus, however not sure about success though.

Setting Up Goal are just like setting up blabalbla

But first let's breakdown the semantics so we are align in these premises.


Vision
Objective
Goals

then we got more business-ish terms like

KPIs
OKRs
Milestones

then we go into a bit of philosophical sides:

Aspiration
Dream
Manifestation


While we understand the meanings of the description, do we understand the meanings behind our understanding?

The way we understand the description are exactly the way we implement the meanings of the words to our life.

We implement what we thought we understand.

And this short writing was meant to breakdown that Goal are just useless as what we thought it is.

Well we can have a the best goals ever, which specifics, measurements, making sure it's attainable, relevant and timely. We can surely breakdown our goal in such matter but still, it was meant to give you some highlighted route to achieve your goal.

The problem with such direction is that, it forgo some important parts.

The longevity or integrations of it.

I set my goal when I was 20 years old to finally get a job at a place I dreamed of, I did it. I hated it, and quit after 6 months. Then I set out a new goal which basically just a new company, and still hate it and I quit.

Set a new goal to make it a little bit vague but big enough, which I want to work overseas internationally, and I got it, still not exactly what I thought it is, and I quit.

Same, I have another goal which to reach certain amount of Salary, and I got it, I got 5-figure salary at the age of 23 and didn't capable to maintain it that long.

What happened is, when you set a goal, you don't set a condition for that goal to be achieved.

At least that's what I don't set. 

I don't set the anti-goal, and I don't set the right pre-requirement of achieving that goal.

Well now the real fun begins,

I have my goal, but to achieve that goal, it must have condition which making sure that I didn't "just" achieve that goal, and alignment, where I make sure that I deserve achieving that goal.

And these approach is what I called set a "Milestone".

You want a milestone, a goal that integrated with your life journey, that not only integrated but also embedded in your true reasonings.

Some people set out goals to certain extend just "because", which is good cause it gave you sense of direction, but it will not exactly helps you in a long run. Instead set a milestone, from your time now, in 5 years what you going to achieve?
