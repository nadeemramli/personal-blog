I've always seen a pattern and a negative cause-effect relationship with advancement and production.

I've always seen people that has been producing a lot (creating value) somehow always have to compromise/trade-offs advancement.

The people that stays in the "cave", has this mentality or state of "ignorance is a bliss".

To shut off the doors of updates, new things, innovation, you have to understand the trade-offs. 

This somehow related to my writing about [[Begin Optimization]].
