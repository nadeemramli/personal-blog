At this moment, I'm working at [FAR Capital as a Technical Marketer.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnadeemramli/)

I handled bunch of stuff that required digital analytics, and product/growth.

Check out my portfolio:
1. Growth:
	1. [A Learning Platform for Property Enthusiast and Beginner](https://far.academy/)- I manage the product experience and growth
	2. [A Growth Analytics Agency](https://www.adasight.com/) - Did a bunch content for them and refining their Value Proposition
	3. [A POS System for Home-based/Small Business](https://wasep.me/) - I currently freelancing here, doing performance marketing and aswell Growth in general.
2. Business:
	1. [A Retail-Focus Digital Activation Agency](https://terokadigital.com/) - This has been my dearest business that I tried to build, still *jalan* but tough road man haha
		1. But if you are a business with a brick and mortar operation, that wanted to increase sales through digital marketing, but always have issues to do that previously? You might need digital activation first. [Hit me up](https://twitter.com/nadeemramli)
