I've read somewhere about "If You're So Smart, Why Are You Unhappy"? or why are you not happy, something like that.

The interesting part of this axiom is that

it challenges you to actually figure out the problem,
but it also challenges you to think that the solution are not through "thinking"

What happened with the ideas is that, it should gives you a praxis, a practical ideas and aswell thought provoking philosophy.

The balance between the two is great
