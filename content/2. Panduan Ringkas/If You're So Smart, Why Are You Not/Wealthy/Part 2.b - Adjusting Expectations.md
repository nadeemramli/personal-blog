 Buy a house, get a huge Cashback.

Use that Cashback to start your business.

Grow cash in that business, until you have more capacity to inject cash thru loans.

Have that system lock in, so you can start doing what you like.
- write those books
- make those channels 
- live your lifeee
- spend more time with ayraas
- code and build more
- do whatever you want 

Make it a proper business, with a complete system and growth forecast.

Lock in, into that business.

All that while ensuring you're not risking future's saving/etc.
- make sure your saving is growing 
- make sure your investment is compounding and growing


I need to know the numbers, 
- Am I positive this month?
	- If I pay everything
		- House
		- Debt
		- Ayra's
		- etc
	- If not, how much do I need, this month, or next month to do so?

You also have to take note there are some timely driven events that can't that big, that is
your daughter schools etc
buying a house
buying a car
umrah/haji 
ibu's 
medical checkup etc 
yearly health check

the question here are
what am i not doing?
what am i overlooking?
what's the reason im not doing, and how can i mitigate that?


add a function where you can model, the thing you wanna do: buying a house, how's taht model looks like?
etc
