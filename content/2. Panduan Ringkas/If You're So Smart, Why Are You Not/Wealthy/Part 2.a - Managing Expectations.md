 Pre-requirement:
1. What data is required?
- remember your behavior when it comes to spending, have you use ATM? do you hold cash?
- what apps you're using, why? can you track it? you might wanna change your apps?
- think differently

TNG, Grab data. 


2. How can we ensure these output from these data platform, congested into your data pipeline, properly without needing to kept on transfering it manually?
- what's the rhythm of the operation? - every END OF MONTH? during gaji? 
- what's the process? - download, input?
- what's the back-end of that process?



First,

Clean and Make Sure Data here and there is completed.

Then, make double verify the data, 

Use a standardized column header.

Make sure each data within those cells, is proper - credit (negative) -debit (positive)

once we have this, (the best one is the one that we can see a clearer transaction details)

we can processed those transaction data, to see 


day by day 

how are we using the money? (logic of the data) - What happen? (is it just transfer within account, or we spend the money out from our pocket, or we paying debt? or we paying ourselves), how the money flows? - direct, QR, through third party? credit? cash? -  the context of the money flows? why are we doing so? what expenses? category of expenses aswell?
We should see all this in one table, where we track all spending day by day for any given month.

some of these questions might can be answer manually, the idea is to use the tool to prompt to us, (what's happening here brother?)

once we have a complete Financial Awareness/Profile

we should begin to analyze, 

the outcome of the spending
- we're spending oftenly where? 
- are we spending for foods? 
- what are the pattern? kekerapan of those purchase? 
- where do we usually overspend? underspend? where do we actually overvalued (paid too much for something that can get cheaper for an example), we paid for interest? unecessary spending?
this should be on other tabs, that show insights, where we use the earlier pivot table to drive these insightts


We then should see a tab that have 

our financial projection, forecast
our actualized financial position (once we input the statements, these number should go out) 

we can directly see, where are we flopping in realization

are we expensing too much?
are we adding a bit more debt?
are we not paying our debt?
is our debt increasing due to interest somewhere?
are we saving our surplus as we should?
are increasing our income as we should?


The projection should help you make informed decision on this, not making decision for you.

Can we be more aggressive?
- buying a house
- using the cash for business 
- using the cash for trading

Should we be more conservative?
If aggressive, we would add a one time expenses into our projection and actualization, which then impact overall

not just that, by having data and visualization of your current self vs. projection. 

you can set up the next month, whether to increase more income (get more hustle) or reduce expenses so much, or save more, or pay more debt

The goal is to make sure your life is producing quality 

Financial Decision 
Compounding Effect of that Decision 
Optionality and Opportunity 
Small Bets and Big Win
