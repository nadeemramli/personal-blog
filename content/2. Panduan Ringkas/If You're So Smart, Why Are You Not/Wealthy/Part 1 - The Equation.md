 It's rather hard building something without a guiding policy that can ensure your action (is coherent with your intention and expectation) align with your end goal. 

The old timid setting up SMART goal, building a habits, setting up automation account, and so many other "tactics" out there work in the past, (I've personally use it) but over a long run, you begun to bump out with more and more uncertainty, expanding the horizon of what's you're planning against, and suddenly in the end. It doesn't work anymore.

I think the best way for us to approach this is to understand the equation of wealthy. 

I took this idea from a great DTC Marketing Agency that I love reading their article, they call it "Growth Equation", which then they use it to become the foundation of their specialization (they have a lot of tactics, and models to breakdown Growth). 

So I think, why not we're using the same approach?

They've been using it for a while and it's going great, maybe we can transfer learn it, so we can be great.
