Learning is a great tool.

It's a tool that allow you to aware, understand and hypothesize reality a little bit better.

But it was not meant to be the only tool you should be using. 





Not all articles, or books are worth to read or even to take note of.

A habit to "capture" information for the sake of capturing, can a bad notion aswell.

To me, I believe simplification matters, but context provide depth. 

Ideas are important but it should've been a simple way to understand it. 



Build judgment to understand how to get high quality information

Get information into it (adding data to obsidian)
	using readwise etc

organize it
	meta data
	connecting tags
	connecting ideas

synthesize it (enriching the data)
	building page relationships
	progressive summarization

creation
	


productivity
	projects
	weekly plan
	daily productivity
